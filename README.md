Hi There,

This was an interesting project.
I've been fascinated by document management systems, and how data management and metadata management might support a new way to locate, access, and view files.

The dashboard I have made looks at the metadata for the IT-CMF, the gold standard for CIOs. The dashboard threads all the capabilities together based on their metadata-associations. 

As you'll find when getting the graph to load, there is a lot of dimensions occuring at each control, capability within this framework. On average, the CIO capabilities are fixed at
10 dimensions of thinking. If you think that's easy, it's not. and getting structural and ordered progression through such a framework is equally complex.

The purpose of the tool was to help me revise for something that I've been obsessed with; what a CIO actually does. The layers of thinking and organisational understanding is beyond the
surface; which takes years and years of experience to gain. It's not something I have the experience to do, but I have the passion to do.

The book this comes from is about 800 pages long. That book is now displayed on a single pane of glass through technology mostly java, html, json, and python) to enable a new form of IT engagement.
As you click a node, the details are then split across the other half of the screen across all the key aspects of thinking.

What this can grow into is something fascinating. By taking meta data on research papers, books, documents, and similar, a design can be overlayed to paint maps of relationships. 
Looking up key data in a timely manner becomes far more efficient in the process - especially for anyone who's an expert on particular topics. or looking to navigate what's present.

This might not be useful for an 'old-timer' who has been in the profession for decades; but it is highly usefull for a 'youngg kid' who doesn't know where to start - or more importantly;
has many dimensions of thought occuring in their mind, yet no structure that aligns well with it. [You still have to read the documents however :) ]. Perhaps this tool can change that. It helps me
to navigate across many different topic areas at speed, and to also remind me what is connected to what; so I have foundations for learning, developing, and growing.

I've never played with coding to this extent either; the whole thing has been entirely fun. i've gone from being unknown to java script, html, python, and jsons; to being able to set up a complex data
transformation mapping from databases through to input for an interactive graph. 

I've got some more ideas lined up next.
